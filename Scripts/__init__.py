The Python repository "CAAthickness" contains the scripts, data, 
figures, and text for an intercomparison study of Arctic sea ice 
thickness in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Attention is given
to first-year ice. We focus on the period from April 2010-2017
for sea ice thickness and snow depth. A variety of data sets
are assessed (including CryoSat-2, PIOMAS, Warren snow climo)
